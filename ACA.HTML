        <h2>SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFY LADY IN THE MULTIVERSE</h2>
        <p> On this special day, when the world has asked us to celebrate women, I want to shout out to someone who has been a part of my live for a very long time now. It was like yesterday, when I saw someone out of the blue looking like me (I thought it was a dream until people began to ask if we were twin). It was then that I realised that the universe was not making a mistake and I appreciated the Love of God more because He had given me the greatest gift of my life since birth. These almost eight years (8) of knowing you have been filled with, Love and more Love, hapiness and more hapiness, victory and more victory.  </p>
        <p>Till today my prayers have not changed and my aspiration still remain that; I know someday I will be your hubby, am sure by then, me and you will be ready; I will be a man and I will be fine; and like a husband to my wife, I will be fine.
            With your permission today, allow me to add another name to the numerous names that this journey with you have birthed. The name is 
            'MY PEARL'.
        </p>
        <P>Words are failing me in describing and explaining all that is in my heart. This is in no way, up to 10% of what I have to tell you or how i feel about YOU. </P>
        <h2>I LOVE YOU MY PEARL</h2>
